# Project
This app was made with the purpose of aiding walkers that like myself, struggling selecting a hill walk in their local area. The data used in this project was taken from http://www.hills-database.co.uk/.

# Deploying
To set up your own personal app, you will need to make an account with StreamLit. It can take some time for your request to be approved. Below is a link to the app I have created.

# Setting Up
A requirements.txt file needs to be created in your GitLab repo in order for Streamlit to function with your code.

# Version History
The versions of packages I have used in this repo are those downloded on my PC through using Juypter Notebook in Anaconda. You may wish to choose different versions.

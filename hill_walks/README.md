# Project
This app was made with the purpose of aiding walkers that like myself, struggling selecting a hill walk in their local area.

The app plots mountains and hills that are included in the Database of British and Irish Hills. An interactive map feature allows users to see the locations, heights and names of hills and mountains across the UK. The sidebar can be used to plot hills of a certain height and in a certain location on the interactive map. Hills can also be excluded from the interactive map. These may be hills that have been walked already by the app user.

# Deploying
To set up your own personal app, you will need to make an account with StreamLit. It can take some time for your request to be approved. Below is a link to the app I have created.

# Setting Up
A requirements.txt file needs to be created in your GitLab repo in order for Streamlit to function with your code.

# Version History
The versions of packages I have used in this repo are those downloded on my PC through using Juypter Notebook in Anaconda. You may wish to choose different versions.
